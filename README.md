# SM_SL-Conflict_Judgment
An alternative/conflicted Judgment font for Simply Love and/or Stepmania 5.

## Introduction
Ever played a rhythm game for a long time in an arcade location? And then you get back home to practice on Simply Love or Stepmania.
You play and you start missing the judgment words from the arcade (which you may played with it for years)... but you also have to
adhere to judgmentconventions of ITG/FA+ to not to confuse viewers watching your stream. Fear not! I have your solution right here!

## Installation
Stay tuned!

## Inspiration
This Judgment font is based on a few games I've played throughout the years: DanceDanceRevolution, Stepmania (various versions), StepmaniaX, Pump it Up (mobile).
The wording changes often due to petty corporate meddling, but it is as follows:

ITG | DDR | SM5 | SMX | OFX | FA+ | PIU
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |---
Fantastic | Marvelous | Flawless!! | Perfect!! | --- | Fantastic (B) | Perfect (RB)
Excellent | Perfect | Perfect! | Perfect | 289 | Fantastic (W) | Perfect (B)
Great | Great | Great | Great | Great | Excellent | Great
Decent | Good | Good | Early | Early | Great | Good
Way off | Miss | Bad | Late | Late | Decent | Bad
Miss | Miss | Miss | Miss | Miss | Miss | Miss

*What a mess...*

### So what?
So, in SMX, earlies and lates are color coded. It helped me adjust my timing a little bit better. In addition, they have their own (verbose) judgment.
As FA+ is more used in the competetive league, I have to adhere to the (main) wording of those judgments. The ITG judgment is more flexible, and so it receives the treatment a little bit differently.

CFJ (ITG) | CFJ (FA+) | Color |
--- | --- | --- |
Perfect!! | Fantastic!! | Rainbow |
Fantastic | Fantastic | White |
--- | Excellent | Gold |
Great | Great | Lime |
Decent | Decent | Sky |
Bad | --- | Lila |
Miss | Miss | Red |
